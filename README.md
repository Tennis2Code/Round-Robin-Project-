# Tennis Round Robin Project

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to simulate the logistics of a round-robin tennis tournament. Each player competes with every other player, and the system tracks wins, losses, and other relevant match statistics. It then computes the final rankings based on the results.

## Key Features
- **Round Robin Scheduling**: Automatically generates match schedules where each player plays against every other player.
- **Match Results Tracking**: Records match outcomes (win/loss) and updates player standings accordingly.
- **Player Rankings**: Computes final rankings based on wins, losses, and ties.
- **Dynamic Player Input**: Users can add and remove players dynamically to adjust the tournament.

## How It Works
Follow these steps to run the Tennis Round Robin Tournament:
1. **Add Players**: Players are added to the system manually or through a list.
2. **Generate Matches**: The system generates matches based on the round-robin format.
3. **Enter Results**: After each match, results (win/loss) are entered, and player statistics are updated.
4. **Calculate Rankings**: After all matches are played, the rankings are calculated, and players are ranked based on their performance.
5. **Tournament Output**: The system outputs a final standings table showing the rank, number of wins, losses, and any additional stats.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java (or any other language you used)
- **Data Structures**: Arrays/Lists for storing player information and match results.
- **Algorithm**: Round Robin scheduling and match result calculations.

## Features & Enhancements
- **Match Scheduling Algorithm**: Automatically handles scheduling of all players in a round-robin format.
- **Handling of Multiple Tournaments**: The system can manage and track multiple tournaments at the same time.

## Future Enhancements
- **Player Stats**: Track additional statistics such as points won, sets won, or game duration.
- **Multi-Stage Tournaments**: Extend to handle multi-stage tournaments (e.g., knockout phases after round-robin).
- **Online Integration**: Develop a web version of the project to allow online tournament management.
